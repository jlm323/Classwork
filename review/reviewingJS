// VARIABLES AND DATATYPES

// A 1. We assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=)

// A 2. If the variable has been declared with 'let', the variable can be reassigned so it has a new value. 
//e.g. let blue = 42; let blue = 'a color';

// A 3. To assign a variable to an existing variable, we can use the assignment operator to set them equal to one another. 
// e.g. firstVar = 1; secondVar = firstVar;

// A 4. Declare refers to when you are first creating a variable. We can use certain keywords to declare variables like: let, const, and var. Assign refers to giving the variable a value. This is done by using an assignment operator (=) and setting it to a specified value, like this: 
// const versailles = 'France'
// Define refers to the WHOLE process of declaring and assigning.

// A 5. Pseudocoding is an informal way of writing out code so that it is easily understandable and doesn't require following the exact syntax of a language - it is mostly explaining the steps of what the code should do.

// A 5. Around 80-90% of the time should be thinking about how to solve the problem versus actually coding it.
